Challenge 4, assignment 1: The first part of my code calls the different stars used in my code and assigning them each different parameters. The variable 
star was then used inside my function "addStar" to develop the translate, scale, rotate and fill for the stars used in my code. I used a loop command to 
be able to make it easier to put many different types of stars in my code. My stars in the beginning were then called inside the draw function to make them show up on the screen.

Challenge 4, assignment 2: Using the same shapes from my previous code I put a nested loop in the draw funcion which created columns and rows for my stars to create a two-dimensional pattern. I used global variables for hieght and width of the columns and rows to make it to the shapes covered the whole canvas.
